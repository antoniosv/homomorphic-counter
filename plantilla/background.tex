\label{background}

Information security is a broad topic that covers many different aspects, from which two of them are particularly important for this work: confidentiality and authentication. There are some aspects from cryptography that would be relevant to review, such as asymmetric and symmetric cryptography, as well as the concepts: plaintext, ciphertext and key. A brief description of cloud computing and its relevant aspects are to be described, and how secure computing has an impact on it. Finally, the concept of homomorphic encryption will be explained, noting the mathematical properties and its categories of somewhat homomorphic encryption and fully homomorphic encryption.
