\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank all the people who made this dissertation possible, starting with my wonderful professors in the Faculty of Mechanic and Electrical Engineering at Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\'{o}n. 

Dr. Sara Elena Garza, who was both my committee chair and my first programming professor, has been of great influence towards my education on software engineering. From start to finish, she has shown great patience and never once gave up on me. She has always been a great source of motivation, helping me pull through both the classes I have taken under her, and also the projects I have collaborated with her. Whenever I strayed from my goals, her encouragement and positive attitude helped me get back in track. 

Dr. Elisa Schaeffer has always provided me with sound advice and inspiration, despite not having taking classes under her officially. The conversations I have held with her showed her passion towards the topics she teaches, which prompted me to become more engaged with other topics I was not familiar with. Dr. Sergio Alcaraz has been an invaluable professor for my education, and I greatly appreciate his patience and seriousness towards all the questions I asked during class. I had never before met a professor who seemed as pleased as he did whenever I asked questions, which motivated me to learn more of the subject and become engaged in his lectures. Dr. Iris Mart\'{i}nez and Dr. Preethy Rajesh are both amazing professors who have demonstrated that high quality education and kindness are not mutually exclusive. Finally, I would like to thank my professors from my student exchange at University of Ottawa during autumn 2012. Dr. Carlisle Adams introduced me to the world of cryptography, and because of his passion towards the subject, I became truly interested in learning about it, in spite of how complex it seemed.

My friends from Monterrey and Obreg\'{o}n city have provided me with the moral support I needed when I was writing my dissertation. I truly appreciate their kind words when I needed them the most, and also the brief distractions that helped me regain my perspective. In particular, I would like to thank Cassandra Delgado, Leticia Neaves, Alexis Rodr\'{i}guez, Luis Cano, Alan Ch\'{a}vez, Eduardo Villalobos, \'{E}rika Tapia, Marian Ju\'{a}rez, and Emilie Angel.

Finally, I would like to thank my family for their inconditional support, even as we are apart. Particularly, to my mother and role model Celia Vel\'{a}zquez, who throughout my life has supported me in all of my life goals and projects.
