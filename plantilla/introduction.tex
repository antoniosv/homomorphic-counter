\chapter{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Communication has always been one of the most important needs of people, and it is particularly linked to the available technology. Thanks to the advances in techonology, it has become more common to exchange information with our peers. Whether it is our personal data or current location, there are many scenarios where it is necessary to pass that information to another point. It becomes an issue when the information is considered to be sensitive, and thus, the confidentiality must be protected, so that no one other than the sender and the intended receiver get to know about it. The medium used by both the sender and receiver to transmit any piece of information is called a channel, which is often considered to be unsecure. It is assumed that apart from the sender and receiver, there might be a third party that tries to eavesdrop on the communication lines. In this case, it becomes important to protect the confidentiality of the information shared between the sender and receiver. 

For the scenarios where confidentiality becomes important, cryptography becomes an attractive solution, so that encryption techniques are used to put the information in some kind of \emph{safe}, preventing any eavesdropper to learn of its contents. The issue at hand becomes even more interesting when the safe containing the private information does not go directly to the other party, but is rather stored somewhere in the cloud, ie. the internet. As long as the proper encryption mechanisms are put in place, the confidentiality is not necessarily compromised if the data were stored in the cloud. However, merely storing static information is not quite interesting: one would want to modify it as the need arises, such as when updating personal data. Such goal calls for homomorphic encryption, which is an advanced technique used to modify the already encrypted data without compromising its confidentiality.

There are many instances where it is required to send information to someone else. To sign up for a service, for instance, several pieces of information are required. Usually, name and email address are required as basic pieces of information. Depending on the service, telephone number and personal address might also be required. And in such case, the subscriber might actually be worried about how safe his information is being kept. He would feel safer if he had some kind of proof that vouched for the confidentiality of his data. This also affects the service, as less people would sign up for the service if they had no means to protect the data. There are several approaches to protect sensitive data, and one of the most effective ones is based on cryptography.

Cryptography is the study of techniques for secret communication, such as ciphers, that is, encryption and decryption algorithms to be used on data. Commonly, these algorithms are used to protect the data from eavesdroppers that try to pry on it. Ciphers can be seen as the means of putting sensitive data into a box with a lock, and only those with the appropriate secret key are able to access the contents of the box. It becomes troublesome to deal with the secret key, because once it has been found by someone, any piece of data encrypted with the same lock becomes vulnerable to unauthorized access. Often, there is also a secure channel that is mostly dedicated to the exchange of secret keys; however, it is often limited and has certain constraints that makes it unfeasible to use it for anything else.

It has become increasingly common to delegate computing tasks to cloud services in order to save resources. For instance, these services might be used when it cannot be afforded to build and maintain a data center for the storage and computing needs that an investor might have. This is especially the case when the level of activity is seasonal: this is, requiring more processing and storage capabilities than usual during certain periods of the year. Therefore, a common solution is to make use of cloud storage and computing services, so that the costs only increase during these usage peaks. This way, the budget is spent as much as the resources are being employed, while saving configuration and maintenance costs. However, as Srinivasan \cite{Srinivasan:2012:SCC:2345396.2345474} points out, allowing the cloud service to make use of the data has raised concerns on security, since it is hard to trust that the cloud provider will not look at the data and do something with it.

A typical solution to this scenario consists in encrypting the data before storing it in the cloud; therefore, assuring its confidentiality. It is a great solution when it is only needed to read the data, without actually making any changes on it. In order to view the encrypted data, it has to be downloaded and decrypted using the proper secret key. However, when it is required to modify it in some way, it still has to be downloaded and recovered to its plaintext form, before modifying it. Once it has been modified, it has to be re-encrypted and re-uploaded to the cloud, in a potentially slow manner. Abaldi \cite{abadi2009data} that this approach turns out to have high overhead costs caused by the transfer of the encrypted data back and forth between the user and the cloud. In other words, it is very bandwidth intensive to encrypt and decrypt complete tables or columns out of the cloud every time some kind of change or analysis must be performed.

In scenarios where the information is not considered to be sensitive, it would be appropriate to make use of cloud computing services directly, as it would cause no harm to grant access to the data that is to be used if it were to be considered public. However, real life applications often imply sensitive data, and it should not be handled trivially, as there is no telling what kind of use an eavesdropper might give to the data.

A simple sounding, yet complicated solution to this problem would be to manipulate the encrypted data in some way such that the contents are not revealed, but on decryption, ends up being correct. In other words, to perform some kind of computation on the encrypted data, even if the private key is not known, so that when it is decrypted, the change is taken into account and the result is the same as if the operation had been performed on plaintext data. For some time, it had been thought that doing something like that was not possible, as ciphers often consisted of permutations and substitutions. However, Rivest et al. \cite{rivest1978data} noted an interesting property found in the RSA algorithm that proved otherwise. Such property is called homomorphic, and has since then gone through a lot of research, resulting in many schemes such as ElGamal, Goldwasser-Micali, Benaloh, Paillier, among others.

\section{Problem Definition}

Even though there are many homomorphic encryption schemes that have been created to allow for computations on encrypted data, so far, they are not considered appropriate to build efficient secure cloud computing solutions. In recent years, a couple of homomorphic cryptosystems implementations have surfaced, namely: HElib \cite{helib} and FHEW \cite{fhew}. However, they are best thought of building blocks in homomorphic encryption. Even though both implementations are based off optimized versions of the proposed homomorphic schemes, there have not been attempts to use these libraries to build solutions in cloud computing. As there have not been attempts at it, it has not been shown if it is still unfeasible to build a software solution using an homomorphic scheme. In this case, feasibility is put in terms of processing time and required storage size. 

\section{Motivation}

As P{\"o}tzelsberger \cite{potzelsberger2013kv} points out in an article on homomorphic encryption, there are many areas in which homomorphic cryptography could be used, such as the medical, marketing, and financial fields. Until now, there was no way to make a concrete implementation related to these areas, since most available schemes where either too limited or too slow.  Using HELib, it would be possible to reevaluate the situation and show to what degree it would be feasible to make a solution based on homomorphic encryption.

\section{Hypothesis}

Building a client-server solution using the homomorphic encryption functionalities provided by HElib is feasible in terms of processing time.

\section{Objectives}

\paragraph{General Objective}

To develop a client-server based solution using HElib to perform homomorphic evaluations on encrypted data.

\paragraph{Specific Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
\item To establish a client-server architecture where homomorphic encryption can be applied.
\item To identify which factors pose a challenge to deem applications of homomorphic encryption as inefficient.
\item To show the use of HElib to setup, encrypt, and decrypt as simple as can be.
\item To collect performance data on the use of homomorphic encryption.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Study Case}

Consider the scenario where a household has an expected pattern of activity, ie. empty during the day, non-empty at night, so that the householder seeks to ascertain the number of people inside at any point in time during the day. Assuming the householder has put in place certain sensors around the building so that it detects and counts who comes in and out, he would like to learn of the value of the counter remotely. As the householder chooses to store the value in the cloud, he quickly realizes he does not want others to learn of this value, not even the cloud service itself, as to prevent potential burglars to break in. Additionally, he wishes that the counter gets updated at certain intervals, e.g. every 20 minutes. A typical solution consits in encrypting the counter every time it is recalculated, replacing the older value stored in the cloud server. Considering the overhead costs of this process, he considers another potential solution that makes use of homomorphic encryption. This solution operates so that only the householder gets to learn of the secret counter value, and the counter itself is updated by the cloud service without requiring the private key. Finally, whenever he needs to know of the current value of the counter, he can download the encrypted value and, using the previously generated secret key, decrypt the data to obtain the value of the counter.
